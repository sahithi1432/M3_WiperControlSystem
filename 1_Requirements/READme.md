## INTRODUCTION

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper 
Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be
handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the
driving. Thus, this system is proposed to solve all these problems. The concept of this wiper system is similar with
other conventional wiper, yet this system will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a controller.
Whenever the water hit a dedicated sensor that located on windscreen, it will send a signal to move on the wiper motor.
Once water is not detected by sensor, the wiper will automatically stop. This will help the driver to give more
concentration and reduce the car accident probability.
In this project, there were two innovations reviewed as the literature review. The two were designed with different
concept and operating mechanism however with same objective of working principle of the car wiper. The rain sensor
was a highly versatile device for automatic wiping of vehicle windscreen when it is wet due to moisture, raindrops or
even mud . It worked by reflecting harmonious light beams within the windscreen. When raindrops fall onto the
windscreen, this harmony light is been disturbed and creating a drop in the light beam intensity. The system then
activated the wipers to be operated in full automatic mode. It has a response time at 0.1 seconds. It allowed for a quick
reaction when it is a sudden splashes of water that will make the driver totally ‘blinds’ when the situation happened.
With the automatic wiper, the driver can avert from the risk of an accident. The automatic wiper is important during
the heavy traffic e.g. in town, city, school zone and other public place. A driver may be subjected to many distractions
with bad weather, dangerous road conditions and fatigue. The Rain Sensor reduced the driver’s burden by making the
driving more comfortable. Trailing a wet car is no longer a nuisance as detection of even 0.005 milliliters of water is
possible.
